# Frontend - DID-IoT Device Registry

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## ⚠️ Important Setup Step

**Before running the app, you MUST create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory (only once!):**

1. Create a file named `.env` in the `frontend` folder (create it only once)
2. Add the following line (replace with your deployed contract address):
   ```
   REACT_APP_DEVICE_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=0xYourDeployedContractAddress
   ```

**To get the contract address:**
- For local development: Run `npm run deploy:local` in the root directory and copy the address
- For Sepolia testnet: Run `npm run deploy:sepolia` in the root directory and copy the address

**After creating the file once, you only need to update the address in the same `.env` file when:**
- You deploy to a different network (local vs Sepolia)
- You redeploy the contract (new address)
- You switch between networks

**You don't need to recreate the file each time you run the app - just update the address when needed!**

**Without this file (or with a zero address), the MetaMask connection button will be disabled!**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
